Steps to create a django project
  --> first install django using pip install django
  --> create a project folder
  --> open the terminal and inside the project folder type in the command "django-admin startup project "projectname ."
"
  --> the period (.) creates the project in the current project

  --> settings.py module  is used to define various settings in our application
  --> urls.py is used to define what the user will see on different pages of the app -- shopping cart, contacts etcetra
  --> wsgi.py is the webserver gateaway Interface --- provides astandard interface between applications built with django and web servers.
  --> manage.py we use it to manage our python project
   e.g inside your project directory using the terminal add the following command:
   (py manage.py runserver)
   we can use it to create an app in our project example(products):
   -->("py manage.py startapp products")--<You will have a package>
         -->admin.py shows how the admin pannel of this app  will look like
         -->apps.py is used for configuration settings of this app
         -->models.py is used for modelling the cooncepts of this app using classes
         --> tests.py used conducting automated tests on the app
         --> views.py used to show what the user can se when navigating to a certain page

--> URL Mapping - 
 steps
 1. first go to the view.py module create a new fuction
 2. Go to the urls module of that app and define a new url path --> if there is none create one
 3. Then go to the urls.py in the root directory of the project
 4. Add the path of the url of your app in the url patterns list eg:
  path("products/", include("products.urls")),
 
-->Creating a Model in Your Django Project
      yo go to your models.py package create a class and give it atributes
      e.g
    <class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    price = models.FloatField()
    stock = models.IntegerField()
    image_url = models.CharField(max_length=2048)> etcetra

--> Db sqlite  
        drag and drop your database to your "db browser for sqllite"
        --> You can automatically create  a table in your db using django by running the following command in the terminal ;
        <py manage.py makemigrations>
        ("No Changes Detected")--> this is brought by because by default Django does not know about your app this can be solved by :
            --> Go back to your project root package for this case its "pyshop"
            --> then enter the settings.py module
            -->inside the settings.py module find the "INSTALLED_APPS" list
            --> Now Register your app("in this  project --> products") in this list
                add the apps name in the list
        -->Enter the  same command again <py manage.py makemigrations>
        --> Then enter another command <py manage.py migrate>
        --> Now your database should be populated with tables

 
<Django Admin >
--> Creating a Super User
        -type in the command <py manage.py createsuperuser>

<Customizing The Admin Panel>
--> Go to the admin.py module of your app i.e in the products package
--> Create a new class and give it atributes like:
    <class ProductAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ("name", "price", "stock")>
